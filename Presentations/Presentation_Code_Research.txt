FLEX-BOX
==========

#atf {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    flex-wrap: nowrap;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: #7cff6e;
}

-ensures elements behave predictably when page
 layout must accommodate different screen size
 
- display: flex
    -A flex container is declared by setting the 
     display property of an element to flex (rendered as a block)
     
- flex-direction: specifies direction of flexible items inside the container.
                  
                  -in this case we used flex-direction: column 
                   which allows horizontal text to be laid out vertically.
                   
-align-items: 
            -property vertically aligns flexible container item when
             items do not use all available space.

    align-items: center   
            - items are positioned at center of container vertically.
            
-flex-wrap: 
        -property specifies whether item should wrap or not, if there
            is not enough room for them on one flex line
            
    flex-wrap: no wrap 
        - default -value, items will not wrap
        
-justify-content:
        -items are positioned at center of container

html, body, #atf{
        height: 100%;
        }
        
        
-shows certain content above the fold...

height 100% will take up whole page above the fold

        
        
        
====================
Using Media Queries
====================

@media screen and (max-width: 790px){

    .column {
        width: 100%;
    }


its uses @media rule to include block of 
css properties only if certain conditions are met

in this case we are checking screen width, 
and height to determine which instructions to carry out

@media screen and (max-width: 700px)
    media query will be true when viewport is 700px wide or less
